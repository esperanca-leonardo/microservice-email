## Setting up Gmail authentication
This project uses Gmail for sending emails. You will need to generate an app password for your Gmail account. Follow the instructions [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) to generate an app password.

## Initial setup
Before launching the application, make sure to set up the following environment variables in your system. Default values are provided for convenience.
```bash
SERVER_PORT=8080

MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=youremail@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password

DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_NAME=microservice_email
DATABASE_USER=user
DATABASE_USER_PASSWORD=123
```

## Automatic Setup
To make the setup easier, you can run the following script in a Windows terminal. This script will automatically set all the required environment variables:
```bash
@echo off
setx SERVER_PORT 8080

setx MAIL_HOST smtp.gmail.com
setx MAIL_PORT 587
setx MAIL_USERNAME your_email@gmail.com
setx MAIL_PASSWORD your_app_password

setx DATABASE_HOST localhost
setx DATABASE_PORT 5432
setx DATABASE_NAME microservice_email
setx DATABASE_USER user
setx DATABASE_USER_PASSWORD 123
```

## Running the Script
1. Create a text file and copy the script above.
2. Save the file with a `.bat` extension, like `set_environment_variables.bat`.
3. Run the file by double-clicking on it or running it through the Windows terminal.

This script will automatically set the required environment variables for the application. You only need to run the script once, and the variables will be permanently set on your system.

## Note
Make sure to replace the default values `youremail@gmail.com`, `your_app_password` with the correct values for your environment before running the script.
